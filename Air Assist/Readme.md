These are the files for the custom air assist nozzle I created. I am attaching the the STL file along with a STEP and F3d file in case you need to make any changes.

It was designed to work with a PTC connector that has a M5 Thread on the end.

This model uses 1 X M3 heat insert (with outer diameter of 5mm) and 1 X M5 heat insert. I can't recall the exact outer diameter of the heat insert, but the hole that acepts it is 8.2mm in diameter. So any M5 heat insert with a larger diameter than that should work (within reason). 

I may make changes to this model since we can't align mirror 3 and the beam clips the tip of the nozzle a bit. Either by mofifying the mounting screws (allowing for more play in the x and y direction) or by adjusting the dimensions of the cone and outlet.
