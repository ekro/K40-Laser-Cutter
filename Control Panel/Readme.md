These are the associated files used for the control panel upgrade on the K40 Laser Cutter.
I have uploaded the STL files along with the STEP and F3d files in case you need to make any modifications to the models. (everything except for the knob. I only have an stl for that)

This was designed to be used with a Reprap Discount Full Graphic Smart Controller.

The assembly requires 4 X M3 heat inserts to attach the controller to the back. (the ones I used have an outer diameter of 5mm)

The knob that is uploaded only works with our specific encoder, so you will likely need to print off a different model depending on your specific controller.
